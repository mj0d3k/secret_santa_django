# secret_santa_django
Hello!

This is my first big project - welcome to secret santa simulator. The application has two ways to play. The first is Quick Game, which allows the user (even if not logged in) to simulate secret santa - the result is to draw gift pairs and send emails to their mailboxes. Disadvantage: data from Quick Game does not save to the database. The second option - a logged-in user has access to his added elements (Events, Groups, Players) and can run such a simulation repeatedly. The result: shuffles on the page to be previewed (preview optional), e-mails sent and a record in the database. User can also check his upcoming events, in whichh he is a giver. Bonus option: Check My Games -> for not logged user - allows you to check your email in the database for your events.

Have fun!
